I started a new project as the project leader to conduct a usability study for Mission HydroSci (https://mhs.missouri.edu/), a game-based virtual learning environment that brings innovative game design to middle school science education.  <br>
My team have completed a <b>Heuristic Evaluation</b> report using a *Instructional Game Evaluation Framework* and submitted it to the client. 
In addtion, we have done a pilot test for the future UX test.
